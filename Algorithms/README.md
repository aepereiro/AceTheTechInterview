# Interview Problems Solutions

## Description

This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to common technical interview problems. It serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone preparing for technical interviews, offering detailed solutions and explanations to a wide range of challenges. Each problem is categorized by its nature and includes solutions in various programming languages, aiming to accommodate diverse programming backgrounds.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured with a separate subfolder for each interview problem. Each subfolder contains:

- A solution file in one or more programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- A README.md file that explains the solution's logic, its time and space complexity, and possibly variations or alternative solutions.

Example structure:
/interview_problems
/problem1
- README.md
- solution.py
- solution.js
/problem2
- README.md
- solution.java
- solution.py

## How to Navigate

To explore the solutions, simply navigate to the `interview_problems` directory and choose the problem you're interested in. Inside each problem's subfolder, you'll find a README.md file with an explanation of the problem, the solution approach, and complexity analysis. The solution files are named according to the programming language used.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that is not yet covered in this repository, or if you have an alternative solution or improvement to an existing problem, please feel free to contribute. Make sure to include a README.md with your solution explaining the problem, your solution approach, and the time and space complexity.

## Using the Solutions

Feel free to use these solutions for study and preparation for your technical interviews. However, remember that understanding the problem-solving process and being able to discuss your approach are crucial aspects of technical interviews. Practice explaining your solutions as if you were in an interview setting.
