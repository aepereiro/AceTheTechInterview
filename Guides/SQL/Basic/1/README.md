# Lesson 1: Introduction to Databases and SQL Data Types

Welcome to the first lesson of the Basic SQL module! This lesson will introduce you to the concept of databases, the role of SQL, and the various data types you can use in SQL.

## What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are crucial for managing data in modern software applications. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate that data in relational databases.

## Setting Up Your First Database

Before you can start querying data, you need to set up a database:

### Steps to Create a Database in phpMyAdmin

1. **Access phpMyAdmin**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Log in using the username `root` and the password `notSecureChangeMe`.

2. **Create a New Database**:
   - Once logged in, click on the "Databases" tab at the top.
   - Enter a name for your new database in the "Create database" field. For example, `my_first_db`.
   - Click on the "Create" button.

Congratulations! You have created your first database. Now, letâ€™s explore the different types of data you can store in it.

## SQL Data Types

Understanding data types in SQL is crucial because they define what kind of data can be stored in each column of your tables. Here are some of the most commonly used SQL data types:

- **INT**: A numeric data type used to store integers.
- **VARCHAR(n)**: A variable character string type. `n` defines the maximum length.
- **TEXT**: A text string with a length of up to 65,535 characters.
- **DATE**: Stores a date value in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **FLOAT**: Stores floating point numbers with decimals.

Each data type in SQL serves a specific purpose, and choosing the right type can greatly impact the performance and storage efficiency of your database.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you've learned what a database is, how to create one, and the basics of SQL data types. In the next lesson, we will dive into creating tables and inserting data into them.

Thank you for participating in this learning journey, and see you in the next lesson!
