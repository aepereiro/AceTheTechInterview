## Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Whether you are managing data, running queries, or optimizing databases, SQL is a critical skill in the data-driven world.

## Guide Structure

Our SQL guides are divided into several sections, each designed to cover a specific aspect of SQL learning:

- [**Basic SQL**](Basic/README.md): Get started with SQL basics, learning how to create tables, run simple queries, and perform basic data manipulation.
- **Intermediate SQL**: Explore more complex SQL features such as joins, subqueries, and set operations.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Tackle advanced topics including transactions, indexing, and query optimization.
- **SQL in Practice**: Apply your SQL knowledge to real-world scenarios, with guided projects and examples.

Each guide includes practical examples, best practices, and exercises to help you apply what you've learned.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these guides, we recommend starting with the "Basic SQL" section if you are new to SQL, and gradually progressing to more advanced topics as you become more comfortable with the language. Each section builds on the previous ones, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.
